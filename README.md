# Rock Paper Scissors Simulator

It's just a basic toy project that I used to learn C++ basics a while back.
If you'd like to play against it, you're welcome to download and compile it, or you can also copy and paste the code in an online compiler like this one: https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler
